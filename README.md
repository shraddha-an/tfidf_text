# Text Classification using a TF-IDF Matrix

NLP Project where I build a TF-IDF matrix to classify the sentiment of user reviews from Amazon, Yelp and IMDB.

## What is TF-IDF?

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) determines how important a word is by weighing its frequency of occurence in the document and computing how often the same word occurs in other documents. If a word occurs many times in a particular document but not in others, then it might be highly relevant to that particular document and is therefore assigned more importance.
